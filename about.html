      <p>
        I'm a queer, autistic, Appalachian now living in the Seattle area.
        That's a complicated intersection to be in, but it instilled in me a few
        important traits: attention to detail, clear communication, and a
        passion for accessibility across intersections.

        Until grad school, I lived my whole life in rural West Virginia, far
        outside of the urban tech bubble. Both professionally and personally, I
        helped people understand the tech in their lives where assumed
        infrastructure was nonexistent, pushing intended use well beyond its
        limits. I carry with me a passion for bringing technology out of wealthy
        metropolitan exclusivity.

        Throughout high school and my CS undergrad, I've spent my free time
        designing concept tech brands and product families. I also took numerous
        gender studies classes, just shy of earning a minor. I hope to explore
        tech's social impact, ensuring what we create for tomorrow stands in
        stark contrast with the injustices of yesterday and today.

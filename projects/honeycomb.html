      <h2 class="context">Context</h2>
      <p>This project is a team-based capstone for my graduate MSTI program, currently in progress until my graduation in December 2022. My team is working with the Outreach and Diversion team at Mary's Place, a large Seattle-based nonprofit working on homelessness. This team meets with families, assesses their needs, and helps connect them to resource providers (housing, medical, immigration, food, etc.).</p>
      <p>
        <em>My roles:</em> user researcher, product designer, ux designer, graphic designer, software engineer
      </p>

      <h2 class="problem" id="problem">Problem</h2>
      <p>
        The Outreach and Diversion team currently has no centralized collection of resources and contacts. The closest existing solutions often use outdated info and are not easily accessible. Specialists have to make repeat cold-calls and new specialists have to build their own shortlist over time (this can take years). With this disorganization, families often have to wait for 45+ days to be matched with proper resources.
      </p>

      <h2 class="process" id="process">Process</h2>
      <p>
        TWe began the quarter with secondary research exploring the problem space and establishing research needs. Our second phase consisted of 3 interviews with team managers, a technical walkthrough of the family intake process, and a focus group with Outreach and Diversion team specialists. In our third phase, we analyzed our findings, created user flows and wireframes, and produced a testable prototype to begin user testing after our summer break.

        We will build a flutter-based iOS app with read and write access to a shared database of resources, split into providers and their respective services. Specialists will be able to search for resources based on family demographic info and keep a personal shortlist of favorite resources.

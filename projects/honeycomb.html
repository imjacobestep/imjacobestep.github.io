            Honeycomb is an iOS app designed as a hub for Mary's Place Seattle
            to organize, explore, and share community resources. This was
            created as my graduate launch project at GIX, sponsored by Starbucks
            and Mary's Place. The objective was to help MP's Outreach and
            Diversion team more easily connect families in need with community
            resources.

            Mary's Place is a Seattle-based nonprofit dedicated to providing

            When they pitched their sponsored capstone in my graduate program, I
            immediately knew it was the project for me. I grew up lower income
            in rural West Virginia; this topic was near to my heart. More than
            anything, I wanted to apply my skills to something that would
            actually impact real people, not just build a flashy tech demo.

        <p>
          Families calling Mary's Place wait an average of 45 days before
          getting access to shelter. Our job was to lower this number. To
          identify bottlenecks, we first needed to understand MP's process. We
          began by combing through training materials and reports, and meeting
          with MP's Data Team. At this point, it was looking like our solution
          would be a new intake process that automatically matched families with
          eligible resources.

          <p>
            Our first day of field research began with a contextual inquiry of
            an outreach request where specialists were assisting a family of ten
            living in an SUV. Next, we conducted an interview with the Outreach
            Team manager and a focus group with five team members. In these
            interviews we clarified processes and identified pain points. We
            also had interviewees annotate a print-out of our user flow diagram,
            fixing any mistakes and highlighting bottlenecks.

          <p>
            Knowing shelter capacity was a big issue for Outreach, so we met
            with Intake to learn how they manage this issue. We interviewed the
            Intake Line Manager and had her walk us through how she either
            refers families to Outreach or puts them on a shelter waitlist. We
            learned that Intake already has a shelter-matching system
            incompatible with Outreach's needs. Addressing this would be risky,
            organizational, and out of scope for our project.

            With our problem identified, we needed to craft a solution. MP uses
            Microsoft Teams extensively so we initially considered building a
            chatbot to document and surface resource info in-chat, but this
            would require admin access we couldn't be granted. Instead, we
            landed on building an iOS app specialists could use to contribute to
            and pull from a shared database on their work iPhones.

            with five specialists. In our data model, we separated resources

            With satisfactory user testing results, it was time to lock down our
            features and start development. We decided to build our app using
            Flutter for three reasons: I was already familiar with it, it played
            nicely with Firebase and Google Maps APIs, and its cross-platform
            nature would make it easy to expand in the future.

            We had less than five weeks to go from a Figma prototype to a

            this done we divided front-end and back-end tasks between myself and
            Shih-Hsin respectively, and split features into five weekly sprints.
            I would distribute a new build on TestFlight and Abhi and Saif would

            We finished core development early! With our extra time, we ran
            scripts to stress test our back-end and we manually onboarded over
            130 verified local resources.

            In mid-December 2022, we met with Mary's Place one last time to walk
            team members through our final app and hand over a folder with our
            research notes, code, and thorough documentation. The Mary's Place
            data team is working on an early 2023 internal rollout plan.

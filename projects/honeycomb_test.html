          <p>
            Honeycomb is an iOS app designed as a hub for Mary's Place Seattle
            to organize, explore, and share community resources. This was
            created as my graduate launch project at GIX, sponsored by Starbucks
            and Mary's Place. The objective was to help MP's Outreach and
            Diversion team more easily connect families in need with community
            resources.

          <h3 id="subsection-header">Who is Mary's Place?</h3>
          <p>
            Mary's Place is a Seattle-based non-profit dedicated to providing
            safety, stability, and hope to families experiencing homelessness.

          <h3 id="subsection-header">How did I get this project?</h3>
          <p>
            At GIX, sponsors pitch their projects in a weekly studio class
            during our Spring quarter. Mary's Place pitched at my first class
            meeting, and I immediately knew it was the launch project for me. I
            grew up lower income in rural West Virginia; this topic was near to
            my heart. More than anything, I wanted to apply my skills to
            something that would actually impact real people, not just build a
            flashy tech demo.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 id="subsection-header">Who did I work with?</h3>
          <p>
            Team Honeycomb consisted of Abhijeet Saraf (Lead UX Designer), Saif
            Mustafa (PM), Shih-Hsin Lo (Back-end Engineer), and myself
            (Front-End Engineer). We each had informal titles but, with only 4
            of us and a first quarter entirely dedicated to research, we all
            wore many hats.

        <h2 id="section-header">Secondary Research</h2>
        <p>
          We weren't given a specific problem to solve, so we began our project
          by combing through Mary's Place's current intake statistics, org
          chart, and new-hire training material. We also met with MP's Data Team
          to learn what tools they use, what data is collected, and how we might
          leverage that to lower family wait times. At this point, we assumed we
          would be building a new intake form that algorithmically produced a
          list of known resources a family would likely be eligible for.

          <p>
            We developed a rough user flow diagram tracing family experiences,
            but org charts and brief meetings only gave us so much insight into
            MP's internal workings. To learn more, we observed an outreach where
            specialists assisted a family of ten living in an SUV, interviewed
            the outreach manager, and conducted a focus group with five outreach
            specialists. To close both interviews, we had participants annotate
            our user flow diagram, correcting any mistakes and highlighting pain
            points.

            In our focus group, specialists mentioned that the intake team also
            uses outreach's main online tool for onboarding families. To make
            sure we understood the intake process and gauge whether our solution
            would impact the intake team, we interviewed the intake manager and
            had her give us a technical walkthrough of the intake process.

            notes, labelled high-impact pain points, and discovered our problem.

            Now that we had identified a problem, we needed to come up with a
            solution. Since MP used Microsoft Teams extensively, we explored
            building a custom Teams chatbot that could find resources based on
            input family data and provide shareable resource cards. Admin access
            needed for this proved to be a blocker. Instead, we decided to build
            an iOS app Outreach Specialists could use on their work iPhones.

            To see how well our prototype performed, we made a visit to MP's
            Allen Family Center to test it with five Outreach Specialists.

          <p>
            Our first round of user testing gave us so many great insights! Now
            it was time to integrate the necessary changes into our prototype.
            We wanted v2 to be more interactive and indicative of what we could
            actually code with Flutter. In v1, we were modelling resources as a
            provider-service relationship. With v2, we simplified this and
            instead allowed multiple contacts and resource types.

            Now that we had identified a problem, we needed to come up with a
            solution. Since MP used Microsoft Teams extensively, we explored
            building a custom Teams chatbot that could find resources based on
            input family data and provide shareable resource cards. Admin access
            needed for this proved to be a blocker. Instead, we decided to build
            an iOS app Outreach Specialists could use on their work iPhones.

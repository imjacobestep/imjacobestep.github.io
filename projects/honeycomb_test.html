          <h1>Honeycomb</h1>
          <p>
            Honeycomb is an iOS app designed as a hub for Mary's Place Seattle
            to organize, explore, and share community resources. This was
            created as my graduate launch project at GIX, sponsored by Starbucks
            and Mary's Place. The objective was to help MP's Outreach and
            Diversion team more easily connect families in need with community
            resources.

          <h3>Who is Mary's Place?</h3>
          <p>
            Mary's Place is a Seattle-based non-profit dedicated to providing
            safety, stability, and hope to families experiencing homelessness.
          </p>

          <h3>How did I get this project?</h3>
          <p>
            At GIX, sponsors pitch their projects in a weekly studio class
            during our Spring quarter. Mary's Place pitched at my first class
            meeting, and I immediately knew it was the launch project for me. I
            grew up lower income in rural West Virginia; this topic was near to
            my heart. More than anything, I wanted to apply my skills to
            something that would actually impact real people, not just build a
            flashy tech demo.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Who did I work with?</h3>
          <p>
            Team Honeycomb consisted of Abhijeet Saraf (Lead UX Designer), Saif
            Mustafa (PM), Shih-Hsin Lo (Back-end Engineer), and myself
            (Front-End Engineer). We each had informal titles but, with only 4
            of us and a first quarter entirely dedicated to research, we all
            wore many hats.

        <h2>Secondary Research</h2>
        <p>
          We weren't given a specific problem to solve, so we began our project
          by combing through Mary's Place's current intake statistics, org
          chart, and new-hire training material. We also met with MP's Data Team
          to learn what tools they use, what data is collected, and how we might
          leverage that to lower family wait times. At this point, we assumed we
          would be building a new intake form that algorithmically produced a
          list of known resources a family would likely be eligible for.

          <h3>Exploring Outreach</h3>
          <p>
            We developed a rough user flow diagram tracing family experiences,
            but org charts and brief meetings only gave us so much insight into
            MP's internal workings. To learn more, we observed an outreach where
            specialists assisted a family of ten living in an SUV, interviewed
            the outreach manager, and conducted a focus group with five outreach
            specialists. To close both interviews, we had participants annotate
            our user flow diagram, correcting any mistakes and highlighting pain
            points.
          </p>
          <h3>Questions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Is our user-flow correct and complete?</p></li>
            <li><p>What common issues arise with the current process?</p></li>
            <li><p>How to the outreach and intake teams coordinate?</p></li>
            <li><p>What resources are commonly asked for?</p></li>
            <li><p>How are families prioritized or determined eligible?</p></li>

        <h3>Exploring Intake</h3>
        <p>
          In our focus group, specialists mentioned that the intake team also
          uses outreach's main online tool for onboarding families. To make sure
          we understood the intake process and gauge whether our solution would
          impact the intake team, we interviewed the intake manager and had her
          give us a technical walkthrough of the intake process.

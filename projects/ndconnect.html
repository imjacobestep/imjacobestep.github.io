            A group of friends started Viability, a neurodivergent-led
            non-profit focused on creating community resources for
            neurodivergent folks and providing corporate consulting around
            neuroinclusion. ND Connect formed as an offshoot, aiming to build a
            mentorship community and help create networks of neurodivergent life
            and career support.

          <p>
            WCAG is the most widely accepted web accessibility standard. Most
            sites aim for AA compliance, ensuring things are usable for most
            people without going out of the way. We're specifically building for
            a disabled and accessibility-aware community, so we needed to go
            further than the bare minimum of AA compliance. We started with
            designing all of our components with AAA contrast levels and
            accessible touch target sizes in mind. Our choice to use Chakra UI
            as our front-end component library was also deliberate, specifically
            because of Chakra's deep ARIA screen-reader support. Once we started
            development, keyboard navigation was also a high priority, even
            including dedicated keyboard shortcuts in our connection browsing
            stack.

          <p>
            People with some cognitive disabilities and motor impairments have
            difficulties telling the difference between a button that is clicked
            and one which isn't. Simple changes to make button states super
            clear can make a huge difference and reduce frustration. For ND
            Connect, I combined a more visually engaging skeuomorphic button
            style with our minimal design system. Immediately after testing this
            out on our landing page, we got specific praise for this. Our
            buttons were satisfying to click, and some users told us they would
            click them just because it's fun!

          <p>
            The visual attributes of ND Connect were accessible, but the content
            needed to be too. We were very deliberate about how we worded button
            labels, headers, and input prompts to ensure they were easily
            understandable across disabilities. Text formatting was another key
            choice, bolding key points, avoiding underlining for dyslexic users,
            and using easily-scannable bullet points where possible.

          <p>
            Social platforms can easily trigger social anxiety in users. This is especially relevant considering how many autistic folks experience trauma related to how they're perceived and understood by others. We wanted to ease this as much as possible by making sure our users know how they appear to others on our platform and what comes next. At the end of our setup process, I've given users a preview of their profile, in the same card view that will pop up for other users in their connection matching stack. This gives users that extra piece of mind knowing exactly how they'll be represented to other users and putting all the information they've added to their profile into context.

          <p>
            On a platform all about finding someone who gets you, you need solid
            profile prompts. Our customer interviews and user tests yielded some
            interesting questions people would like to know about each other
            before connecting. We incorporated these as optional prompts to
            complement our identity tag system. This puts a lot of information
            in a profile, so we prioritized the scan-ability of our profile card
            design.

          <p>
            Relationships are complicated, even when solely focused on support in a specific area. Two users might have multiple possible relationship types, and they might not know what their relationship looks like until they've met a few times. Despite that ambiguity and fluidity, our users specifically asked for structured relationship types. To accommodate this, we created a two-stage relationship system. New connections default to 'informal connections'. If things work out and you want a structured relationship type, you can 'commit' to a structured peer-peer or mentor-mentee relationship. Some users also expressed anxiety with ending a connection that wasn't working out. To counter this, we designed an expiring commitment system that gives users a built-in exit from a stale connection.

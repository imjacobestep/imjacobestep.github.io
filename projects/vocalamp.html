            VocaLamp is a prototype smart lamp that adapts lighting, reads word
            definitions, and helps parents reinforce learning. This was created
            as a project for my graduate Hardware/Software Lab 2 class at GIX
            and continued through UWâ€™s CoMotion incubator program. The objective
            was to help parents and children connect over distraction-free
            vocabulary learning

            My grad program had two Hardware/Software Lab classes where we have nine weeks to go from idea to working prototype. VocaLamp started as one of these projects. Our initial idea was a smart bookmark that would sync progress from a physical book to an eBook. After two weeks of research and sketching, our advisor changed his mind on the idea and we had to start over. Having researched the benefits of reading physical books, we pivoted to an IoT children's lamp. I was the only software engineer on a team with Sumayyah (communications), Vinitha (architecture), Abhi (UX), and, working remotely from China, Yiran (architecture).

          <p>We conducted around two weeks of secondary research focusing around the pros/cons of physical vs digital books, and the effect lighting had on reading comprehension. We found that physical books are much better for long-term learning, but lack accessibility features, integrated word look-up, and the ability to easily expand content beyond the text.</p>

          <p>Our lamp would detect when the user turned the page and take a picture. When they pointed to a word, the coordinates would be used to find the corresponding word in the image. A child-focused companion app would contain vocabulary quizzes to reinforce memory of these new words. A parent-focused app would show a learning dashboard. For our Milestone 1 demo, we showcased our working automatic brightness optimization and basic text recognition from an image of a page.</p>

          <p>For Milestone 2, we conducted two rounds of user research. First, we interviewed family members and classmates to learn about the environmental and sensory changes they find most conducive to deep reading. We also conducted contextual inquiries with classmates to learn about their study habits and what tricks they use to remember new things. We found that lighting and sensory aids (a warm drink, background music, something to hold) help improve focus, and that integrating something recently learned into regular life significantly boosted long-term recall.</p>

          <p>For Milestone 2, we made a number of changes to our prototype. We scrapped the planned screen to decrease distractions, added privacy switches to turn off the camera, and attempted (and failed) to switch to a custom-built PCB. Yiran also updated our children's app, removing learning stats and adding more color. We demoed manual light modes and a working gesture detection system that identified hands in-frame, tracked the tip of the pointer finger, and triggered a lighting change when pointing for a given trigger time. We were still working out the kinks in our system for translating those coordinates into words.</p>

          <p>Leading up to Milestone 3, two members of our team (working on the physical body of the lamp and final soldering) had other commitments that limited their availability and I caught covid! Because of these challenges, we cut the children's app and focused on demoing working point-to-word detection and showing those words shared to the parent's app. While I was in quarantine, I wrote our app using Flutter and Firebase and finished the final system code via an SSH client on my teammate's laptop controlled remotely over Zoom ðŸ˜§. Luckily, we got everything working and assembled in our 3D printed lamp body the night before our presentation, leaving just enough time to run a short user test with Sumayyah's daughter. Our demo went perfectly and really impressed our advisors and guest evaluator!</p>

          <p>Though our time working on VocaLamp for school was over, we brought our prototype back online to conduct preliminary user testing. We observed a few parents and their children using the lamp together, identifying areas of future development. We learned that native speakers of English may not benefit as much from our lamp, but ESL students and their parents found it particularly useful. We explored monetization strategies and competitive advantages as members of UW CoMotion's Winter 2023 cohort.</p>

          <h3 id="subsection-header">App Work</h3>
          <p>I developed the parent's companion app further on my own, exploring ways to surface relevant content related to newly learned words. Initially, I added links to Google searches for definitions, images, and videos. Later, I integrated OwlBot's dictionary API to list word variants, definitions, and their usages. More recently, I explored integrating OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and Dall-E 2. When a parent opens the details for a newly scanned word, GPT appears as a personification of the word telling the user about itself in a more natural way than just reading a definition. GPT can also generate a bedtime story about the word. These are just a couple of ways VocaLamp can help parents reinforce word learning by using newly learned words in everyday life.</p>

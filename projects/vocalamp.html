            VocaLamp is a prototype smart lamp that adapts lighting, reads word
            definitions, and helps parents reinforce learning. This was created
            as a project for my graduate Hardware/Software Lab 2 class at GIX
            and continued through UWâ€™s CoMotion incubator program. The objective
            was to help parents and children connect over distraction-free
            vocabulary learning

            My grad program had two Hardware/Software Lab classes where we have
            nine weeks to go from idea to working prototype. VocaLamp started as
            one of these projects. Our initial idea was a smart bookmark that
            would sync progress from a physical book to an eBook. After two
            weeks of research and sketching, our advisor changed his mind on the
            idea and we had to start over. Having researched the benefits of
            reading physical books, we pivoted to an IoT children's lamp. I was
            the only software engineer on a team with Sumayyah (communications),
            Vinitha (architecture), Abhi (UX), and, working remotely from China,
            Yiran (architecture).

            Throughout the quarter, my team conducted research to learn more
            about environmental and temporal effects on learning while reading.
            I started with two weeks of secondary research focused on physical
            vs digital reading. Next, I conducted a series of interviews to
            learn about reading habits and preferred environments and sensory
            stimuli. Lastly, I conducted contextual inquiries, learning about
            study habits and useful strategies for long-term learning. Overall,
            we found that sensory and environmental factors play a huge role in
            long term recall. "Setting the mood" for focus and repeating a
            stimuli while studying can build lasting connections in memory.

            We had three milestones to present work-in-progress prototypes.
            Milestone 1 consisted of working automatic lighting and basic text
            recognition. Milestone 2 was basic gesture recognition with
            triggered lighting changes. Finally, for Milestone 3 we demoed a
            prototype with point-to-word gesture recognition, spoken
            definitions, and syncing with a parent companion app. We streamlined
            our approach throughout the process, cutting a planned screen and
            child-companion app to reduce distractions. We wrote our main lamp
            code in python and developed our simple prototype app with Flutter
            and Firebase. Milestone 3 was almost derailed by myself having to
            quarantine with covid, but we figured out a system of controlling
            our Raspberry Pi via VNC on a laptop I controlled via Zoom on my
            laptop (we made it work!).

            Though our time working on VocaLamp for school was over, we brought
            our prototype back online to conduct preliminary user testing. We
            observed a few parents and their children using the lamp together,
            identifying areas of future development. We learned that native
            speakers of English may not benefit as much from our lamp, but ESL
            students and their parents found it particularly useful. We explored
            monetization strategies and competitive advantages as members of UW
            CoMotion's Winter 2023 cohort.

            After our teamwork on the app was finished, I had some ideas for
            further development on our companion app. We had discussed adding
            in-app content for parents to engage with their children around the
            words they had learned. First, I added simple Google search links to
            find external content. Next, I replaced our placeholder definitions
            and examples with OwlBot's dictionary API. Eventually, I redesigned
            the app in its entirety, adding a proper back-end and timed learning
            progress. I also added two OpenAI-enabled features. The first of
            these is a GPT-based chat experience, allowing parents and children
            to speak to a new word personified by GPT. For instance, a child can
            ask a villa (a word prompted during user tests) how big it is, or
            who lived in it. The second AI feature is a generated bedtime story,
            complete with illustrations. Parents can generate engaging stories
            that help their child learn the word in-context.
